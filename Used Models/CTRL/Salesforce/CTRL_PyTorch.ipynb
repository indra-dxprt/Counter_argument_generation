The only thing left is finding some work where I can afford it but even then I'll probably go back into school because it's what keeps me going. I've had many offers already though mostly at jobs with more than one person working together but that's not something I'd want right now. My main concern here was being honest and giving everyone an accurate picture of what happened and this community helped quite a bit. It's nice knowing there are other folks who care as much as I do. \n"," \n"," Edit2: Apparently I should add a disclaimer here.

''He knows how important it is. He understands it, too. He's going to bring some things from Chicago with him. That's really what's so exciting.'' \n"," It has not worked out well for teams like New England or Green Bay, but the Saints hope Payton's familiarity will help them win more games. Earlier this season, San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci told reporters before the season began that Payton would probably go back to Chicago. But Payton did not. His departure means the 49ers must replace him immediately. \n"," How much difference does all that make? Well, if there were no change, then Favre might look very different.

They were saying that they would be able to take your work and turn it into a document with pictures or other digital media. This seemed very cool but then i realized that if you are using ProTools as part of your studio workflow you will need to know what these things are. What kind of tools do we use in ProTools? How does one go about learning how to make a video from scratch? Where should I start looking? And so on. The more I thought about it, the less sense it made to me when someone said that Pro Tools users could just download everything off the internet and plug them in.

You came home from church and your father would take you to the local ice cream shop (whatever that was) for some free money. This is where my parents started teaching me about morality. They taught us how it should be done, but they also told us not to do it. My dad said he did this because when people are forced to do something, it's hard on them emotionally or physically. When someone does something without thinking of consequences, that's called immoral. That's what morality is. So if you're going out with friends one night, you can have sex with as many women as long as they're willing. If you want to go into business together, then yes, you need to pay taxes. But don't get mad at me if I can't afford to buy a new car every year. Don't call me immoral just because I'm broke. Morality isn't based off money, it's based off morals that we feel right now. We shouldn't judge other people. It doesn't matter whether its right or wrong. It's our choice. And so on. \n"," \n"," The thing is, I grew up believing this. That there were no consequences whatsoever for any actions taken. A lot of things happened back then, and I never knew why. However, I've gotten older now and realized that most everything has consequences. Everything happens around you. Everyone will die eventually.

What is your opinion on this? If it wasn't illegal to drink when driving, wouldn't this be illegal? (Also, what about people who are caught drinking while driving? Would those charges still apply in such cases?) \n"," Edit: Thanks everyone, great question!

We were both pretty drunk so we just kept driving. After about an hour of driving, she said that it was getting dark out and asked if there was any way we could stop somewhere before going home. She had no idea how far away this place was, but knew where the town center was. So i told her that we should go over there. When we stopped by the gas station, they gave us some gas. The next thing I remember is, I woke up in the hospital. They put me back together with only one arm because apparently that hurt even worse than before. It took them two days to get everything sorted out. Because I wasn't allowed to drive, I couldn't do anything until then. But what really made things worst was when I went to school on Monday. Everything seemed normal there, but as soon as class ended, all hell broke loose. There were fights between students everywhere. Some people started throwing rocks at other students, which resulted in several injuries. One girl ended up breaking her arm. Another student ran into traffic and died. And then last night, someone threw acid inside our school.
