## Code structure

We can see three sub folders here. Each sub folder has a specific set of code

## Graph

Within this sub folder we can see the code for building the transative dependency within the graph, Extending the graph with our Kialo data and to find the node based on Euclidean distance.

## Pipeline for Data extraction

Within here we can see two pipelines for our approach. One is using the sentiment and emothion and other is using the Page rank idea.
